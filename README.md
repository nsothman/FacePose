# FacePose
In this project, I will attempt to create a tool that detects the pose of the user's face to determine whether they're sitting up straight while working.

## Objectives:
* Integrate a face detection model with a python script to easily download it
* Use novel face and shoulder pose detection algorithms to measure how upright the person is sitting
* Create real-time and background versions
* Attempt to integrate notifications for the version running in the background
* Make sure the background version does not interfer with other uses of the webcam
* Add a makefile and a bash file for adding the background version as a service to Ubuntu
